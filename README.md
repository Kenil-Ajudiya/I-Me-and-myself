- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kenil-Ajudiya
- 👀 I’m interested in time-domain radio astronomy in general and fast radio bursts (FRBs) and ultra-long period transients (ULPTs) in particular.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with the SPOTLIGHT team on a GPU-accelerated pulsar processing pipeline for the project. I am driven to pursue a research career in the field of radio transient search, their possible emission mechanisms and statistical correlation analysis to improve our understanding of these sources.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a doctorate research position.
- 📫 How to reach me? Drop me an email: kenilr@iisc.ac.in
